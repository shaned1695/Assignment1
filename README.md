You must press "1", "2" or "3" to change the speed of the stars


Things I wish I could fix
a)  Wanted to rotate the radar in the bottom right corner and have it detect if any other ships were close. However, as I was already         using a translate so that the stars were coming from the centre of the screen, I couldn't find a way to do this.
b)  Originally I wanted to be able to click on the white buttons instead of having to press 1,2 or 3 on the keyboard but I found this 
    much tougher than I anticipated.
